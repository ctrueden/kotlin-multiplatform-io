This repository is an attempt to use [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform-library.html) to create an I/O-focused library that works as a native shared library, a JAR for the JVM, and from JavaScript.

This is based on the scifio master + manual cherry picking from `blocks-are-so-plane` 
branch from Mark Hiner

Current supported format so far:
- SDT
