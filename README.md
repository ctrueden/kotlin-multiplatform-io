This repository is an attempt to use [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform-library.html) to create an I/O-focused library that works as a native shared library, a JAR for the JVM, and from JavaScript.

Right now it fails to build due to the [kotlinx-io](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx-io/) dependency declaration not being recognized. So the attempt to use kotlinx-io API fails to compile. As far as I can tell, the dependency declaration is done [according to the documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform-add-dependencies.html), so I am stumped as to why it does not work.
